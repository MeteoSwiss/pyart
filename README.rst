The MeteoSwiss version of the Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART)
===============================================================

This is the MeteoSwiss version of `the Python ARM Radar Toolkit, Py-ART <http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/>`_. This version contains features developed at MeteoSwiss that have not yet been pulled into the ARM-DOE Py-ART. MeteoSwiss contributes to the ARM-DOE Py-ART on a regular basis.

Users of `Pyrad <https://github.com/meteoswiss-mdr/pyrad>`_ that want to exploit its full functionality should preferably use this version instead of the ARM-DOE one. The MeteoSwiss Py-ART is a submodule of the Pyrad superproject.

Installation
============
To install the MeteoSwiss Py-ART as part of the Pyrad superproject have a look at the `Pyrad user manual(pdf) <https://github.com/meteoswiss-mdr/pyrad/blob/master/doc/pyrad_user_manual.pdf>`_


Use
===
For details on the implemented function check the `MeteoSwiss Py-ART library reference for users <https://meteoswiss-mdr.github.io/pyart/>`_. Downloadable copies can be found in the Pyrad repository:

`For users(pdf) <https://github.com/meteoswiss-mdr/pyrad/blob/master/doc/pyart-mch_library_reference_users.pdf>`_

`For developers(pdf) <https://github.com/meteoswiss-mdr/pyrad/blob/master/doc/pyart-mch_library_reference_dev.pdf>`_

Development
===========
Suggestions of developments and bug reports should use the `Issues page of the Pyrad github repository <https://github.com/meteoswiss-mdr/pyrad/issues>`_.

We welcome contributions. The process to contribute by partners external to MeteoSwiss is described in the `Pyrad user manual <https://github.com/meteoswiss-mdr/pyrad/blob/master/doc/pyrad_user_manual.pdf>`_. However consider contributing directly to the ARM-DOE Py-ART to serve a broader community.
